## Exercise I

a) Thr urn time is O(n^c) - Polynomial because it takes more steps the larger n gets. We have to multiply n*n until we meet the condition.


b) The run time is O(n log n) - Linearithmic because j is less than n. J cannot be applied to every i if i starts at 1. The inner loop does not initialize until i is greater than 1. 


c) This run time is O(n) - Linear because no matter the size of the bunnies, each time the function is called, it will increase by two bunnies.
